If $M = N^{4} + x$, and $x$~is small compared with~$N$, then a good approximation
for~$\sqrt[4]{M}$ is
\[
\frac{51}{56} N + \frac{5}{56}\, \frac{M}{N^{3}} + \frac{27Nx}{14(7M + 5N^{4})}.
\]
Show that when $N = 10$, $x = 1$, this approximation is accurate to $16$~places
of decimals. \MathTrip{1886.}
