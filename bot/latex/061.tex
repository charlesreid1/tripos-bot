Four variables $x$, $y$, $z$, $u$ are connected by two relations in virtue of
which any two can be expressed as functions of the others. Show that
\[
y_{z}^{u}z_{x}^{u}x_{y}^{u} = -y_{z}^{x}z_{x}^{y}x_{y}^{z} = 1,\quad
x_{z}^{u}z_{x}^{y} + y_{z}^{u}z_{y}^{x} = 1,
\]
where $y_{z}^{u}$~denotes the derivative of~$y$, when expressed as a function of $z$~and~$u$,
with respect to~$z$. \MathTrip{1897.}
