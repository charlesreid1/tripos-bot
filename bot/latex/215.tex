If $x_{n+1} = \sqrtp{k + x_{n}}$, and $k$~and~$x_{1}$ are positive, then the sequence $x_{1}$,~$x_{2}$,
$x_{3}$,~\dots\ is an increasing or decreasing sequence according as $x_{1}$~is less than or
greater than~$\alpha$, the positive root of the equation $x^{2} = x + k$; and in either case
$x_{n} \to \alpha$ as $n \to \infty$.
