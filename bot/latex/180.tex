Show that any polynomial in~$\sqrt[3]{2}$, with rational coefficients, can be
expressed in the form
\[
a + b\sqrt[3]{2} + c\sqrt[3]{4},
\]
where $a$,~$b$,~$c$ are rational.

More generally, if $p$~is any rational number, any polynomial in~$\sqrt[m]{p}$ with
rational coefficients can be expressed in the form
\[
a_{0} + a_{1}\alpha + a_{2}\alpha^{2} + \dots + a_{m-1}\alpha^{m-1},
\]
where $a_{0}$, $a_{1}, \dots$ are rational and $\alpha = \sqrt[m]{p}$. For any such polynomial is of the
form
\[
b_{0} + b_{1}\alpha + b_{2}\alpha^{2} + \dots + b_{k}\alpha^{k},
\]
where the~$b$'s are rational. If $k \leq m - 1$, this is already of the form required. If
$k > m - 1$, let $\alpha^{r}$~be any power of~$\alpha$ higher than the~$(m - 1)$th. Then $r = \lambda m + s$,
where $\lambda$~is an integer and $0 \leq s \leq m - 1$; and $\alpha^{r} = \alpha^{\lambda m + s} = p^{\lambda}\alpha^{s}$. Hence we can
get rid of all powers of~$\alpha$ higher than the~$(m - 1)$th.
