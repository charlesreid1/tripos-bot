Find the conditions of equilibrium satisfied
by a body which is wholly or partly immersed
in a fluid, and free to turn about a fixed point.

A semi-circular lamina has one of the ends of its 
diameter smoothly hinged to a fixed point above the 
surface of a liquid, and floats with its plane vertical
and its diameter half immersed. If the inclination of the 
diameter to the horizon is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, prove
that the ratio of the density of the liquid to that of the 
lamina is $4 ( 3 \pi - 4 ) : 9 \pi - 8$.  \MathTrip{1906.}
