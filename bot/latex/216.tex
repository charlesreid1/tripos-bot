If $x_{n+1} = k/(1 + x_{n})$, and $k$~and~$x_{1}$ are positive, then the sequences
$x_{1}$,~$x_{3}$, $x_{5}$,~\dots\ and $x_{2}$,~$x_{4}$, $x_{6}$,~\dots\ are one an increasing and the other a decreasing
sequence, and each sequence tends to the limit~$\alpha$, the positive root of the
equation $x^{2} + x = k$.
