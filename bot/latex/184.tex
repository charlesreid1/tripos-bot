We have seen that some irrational numbers
(such as~$\sqrt{2}$) are roots of equations of the type
\[
a_{0}x^{n} + a_{1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{n} = 0,
\]
where $a_{0}$, $a_{1}$, \dots,~$a_{n}$ are integers. Such irrational numbers are called \emph{algebraical}
numbers: all other irrational numbers, such as~$\pi$ (\SecNo[ยง]{15}), are called
\emph{transcendental} numbers. Show that if $x$~is an algebraical number, then so are~$kx$,
where $k$~is any rational number, and~$x^{m/n}$, where $m$~and~$n$ are any integers.
