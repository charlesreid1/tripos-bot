Approximate quadrature of the circle: Let $O$~be the centre of
a circle of radius~$R$. On the tangent at~$A$ take $AP = \frac{11}{5}R$ and $AQ = \frac{13}{5}R$,
in the same direction. On~$AO$ take $AN = OP$ and draw~$NM$ parallel to~$OQ$
and cutting~$AP$ in~$M$. Show that
\[
AM/R = \tfrac{13}{25}\sqrt{146},
\]
and that to take~$AM$ as being equal to the circumference of the circle would
lead to a value of~$\pi$ correct to five places of decimals. If $R$~is the earth's
radius, the error in supposing $AM$ to be its circumference is less than $11$~yards.
