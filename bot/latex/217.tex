The function~$f(x)$ is increasing and continuous (see \Ref{Ch.}{V}) for all
values of~$x$, and a sequence $x_{1}$,~$x_{2}$, $x_{3}$,~\dots\ is defined by the equation
$x_{n+1} = f(x_{n})$. Discuss on general graphical grounds the question as to
whether $x_{n}$~tends to a root of the equation $x = f(x)$. Consider in particular
the case in which this equation has only one root, distinguishing the cases in
which the curve $y = f(x)$ crosses the line $y = x$ from above to below and from
below to above.
