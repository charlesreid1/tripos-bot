Leibniz' Theorem: If $y$~is a product~$uv$, and we can form the
first $n$~derivatives of $u$ and~$v$, then we can form the $n$th~derivative of~$y$ by
means of \emph{Leibniz' Theorem}, which gives the rule
\[
(uv)_{n} = u_{n}v
  + \binom{n}{1}u_{n-1}v_{1}
  + \binom{n}{2}u_{n-2}v_{2} + \dots
  + \binom{n}{r}u_{n-r}v_{r} + \dots + uv_{n},
\]
where suffixes indicate differentiations, so that $u_{n}$, for example, denotes the
$n$th~derivative of~$u$.
