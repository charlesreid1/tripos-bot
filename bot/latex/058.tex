The conic of closest contact with the curve $y = ax^{2} + bx^{3} + cx^{4} + \dots + kx^{n}$,
at the origin, is $a^{3}y = a^{4}x^{2} + a^{2}bxy + (ac - b^{2})y^{2}$. Deduce that the conic of
closest contact at the point $(\xi, \eta)$ of the curve $y = f(x)$ is
\[
18\eta_{2}^{3}T
  = 9\eta_{2}^{4}(x - \xi)^{2}
  + 6\eta_{2}^{2}\eta_{3}(x - \xi)T
  + (3\eta_{2}\eta_{4} - 4\eta_{3}^{2})T^{2},
\]
where $T = (y - \eta) - \eta_{1}(x - \xi)$.
