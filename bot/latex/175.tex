\mathbf{Schwarz's inequality.} Suppose that $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, \dots,~$a_{n}$ and $b_{1}$, $b_{2}$, \dots,~$b_{n}$
are any two sets of numbers positive or negative. It is easy to verify the
identity
\[
\left(\tsum a_{r} b_{r}\right)^{2}
  = \tsum a_{r}^{2} \tsum a_{s}^{2}
  - \tsum (a_{r} b_{s} - a_{s} b_{r})^{2},
\]
where $r$~and~$s$ assume the values $1$, $2$, \dots,~$n$. It follows that
\[
\left(\tsum a_{r} b_{r}\right)^{2} \leq \tsum a_{r}^{2} \tsum b_{r}^{2},
\]
an inequality usually known as Schwarz's (though due originally to Cauchy).
