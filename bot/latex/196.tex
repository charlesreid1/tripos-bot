Verify that the equation
\[
\cos\tfrac{1}{2}\pi x
  = 1 - \frac{x^{2}}{x + (x - 1)\bigsqrtp{\dfrac{2 - x}{3}}}
\]
is approximately true for all values of~$x$ between $0$~and~$1$. [Take $x = 0$, $\frac{1}{6}$, $\frac{1}{3}$,
$\tfrac{1}{2}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{5}{6}$,~$1$, and use tables. For which of these values is the formula exact?]
