Any polynomial in $\sqrt{p}$~and~$\sqrt{q}$, with rational coefficients (\ie\ any
sum of a finite number of terms of the form $A(\sqrt{p})^{m}(\sqrt{q})^{n}$, where $m$~and~$n$
are integers, and $A$~rational), can be expressed in the form
\[
a + b\sqrt{p} + c\sqrt{q} + d\DPtypo{\sqrt{pq}}{\sqrtp{pq}},
\]
where $a$, $b$, $c$,~$d$ are rational.
