\Item{15.} Show that the graph of the function
\[
y = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^{n}\phi(x) + x^{-n}\psi(x)}{x^{n} + x^{-n}}
\]
is composed of parts of the graphs of $\phi(x)$~and~$\psi(x)$, together with (as a rule)
two isolated points. Is $y$~defined when (\ia)~$x = 1$, (\ib)~$x = -1$, (\ic)~$x = 0$?
