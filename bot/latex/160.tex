The axis of a wheel and axle is placed in a horizontal 
position, and a weight $y$, which is applied to the 
circumference of the axle, is raised by the application
of a given moving force $p$ applied to the circumference
of the wheel; given the radii of the wheel and axle, it
is required to assign the quantity $y$, when the moment 
generated in it in a given time is a maximum, the inertia
of the wheel and axle not being considered.
