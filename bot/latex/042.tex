{\Loosen Show that by choice of the ratio~$\lambda : \mu$ we can make the roots of
$\lambda(ax^{2} + bx + c) + \mu(a'x^{2} + b'x + c') = 0$ real and having a difference of any magnitude,
unless the roots of the two quadratics are all real and interlace; and
that in the excepted case the roots are always real, but there is a lower limit
for the magnitude of their difference. \MathTrip{1895.}}
