Prove that the relation $z = (1 + Zi)/(Z + i)$ transforms the part of the
axis of~$x$ between the points $z = 1$ and $z = -1$ into a semicircle passing
through the points $Z = 1$ and $Z = -1$. Find all the figures that can be obtained
from the originally selected part of the axis of~$x$ by successive applications of
the transformation. \MathTrip{1912.}
