The roots of a cubic $f(x) = 0$ are $\alpha$,~$\beta$,~$\gamma$ in ascending order of magnitude.
Show that if $\DPmod{(\alpha, \beta)}{[\alpha, \beta]}$ and~$\DPmod{(\beta, \gamma)}{[\beta, \gamma]}$ are each divided into six equal sub-intervals,
then a root of $f'(x) = 0$ will fall in the fourth interval from~$\beta$ on each side.
What will be the nature of the cubic in the two cases when a root of $f'(x) = 0$
falls at a point of division? \MathTrip{1907.}
