Prove that if $(a, b, c, f, g, h \btw x, y, 1)^{2} = 0$ is the equation of a conic, then
\[
\int \frac{dx}{(lx + my + n)(hx + by + f)} = \alpha\log \frac{PT}{PT'} + \beta,
\]
where $PT$,~$PT'$ are the perpendiculars from a point~$P$ of the conic on the
tangents at the ends of the chord $lx + my + n = 0$, and $\alpha$,~$\beta$ are constants.
