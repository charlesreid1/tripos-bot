Prove that the series
\[
1 - \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{3} + \tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{1}{5} + \tfrac{1}{6}
  - \tfrac{1}{7} - \tfrac{1}{8} - \tfrac{1}{9} - \tfrac{1}{10} + \dots,
\]
in which successive terms of the same sign form groups of $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$,~\dots\ terms,
is convergent; but that the corresponding series in which the groups contain
$1$, $2$, $4$, $8$,~\dots\ terms oscillates finitely. \MathTrip{1908.}
