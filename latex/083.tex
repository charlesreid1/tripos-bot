Verify that these formulae may be deduced from the corresponding
formulae in $\cos x$ and $\sin x$, by writing $\cosh x$ for $\cos x$ and $i\sinh x$ for~$\sin x$.

[It follows that the same is true of all the formulae involving $\cos nx$ and
$\sin nx$ which are deduced from the corresponding elementary properties of
$\cos x$ and~$\sin x$. The reason of this analogy will appear in \Ref{Ch.}{X}\@.]

\Item{22.} Express $\cosh x$ and $\sinh x$ in terms (\ia)~of $\cosh 2x$ (\ib)~of $\sinh 2x$.
Discuss any ambiguities of sign that may occur. \MathTrip{1908.}
