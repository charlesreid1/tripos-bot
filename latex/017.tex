Prove that if $t$~is real and $z = t^{2} - 1 + \sqrtp{t^{4} - t^{2}}$, then, when $t^{2} < 1$, $z$~is
represented by a point which lies on the circle $x^{2} + y^{2} + x = 0$. Assuming that,
when $t^{2} > 1$, $\sqrtp{t^{4} - t^{2}}$ denotes the positive square root of $t^{4} - t^{2}$, discuss the
motion of the point which represents~$z$, as $t$~diminishes from a large positive
value to a large negative value. \MathTrip{1912.}
